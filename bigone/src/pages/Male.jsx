      "When it comes to quality and color, no one does cashmere quite like we do. Our best-selling and crazy-soft sweaters are the result of over 30 years of expertise, obsessing over fit, durability and handfeel. The result? They're soft and warm, while still being lightweight, which means they're perfect to layer underneath a jacket now or to wear on their own later. We're proud to support responsible cashmere production through our partnership with the Aid by Trade Foundation (AbTF), a nonprofit that promotes sustainable agricultural development across the globe. As the foundation's first U.S. member, we source cashmere that is certified to the AbTF's The Good Cashmere Standard®, which ensures the welfare of the cashmere goats, protects natural resources and improves the working conditions of farmers and farmworkers in Inner Mongolia.",

Our best-selling and crazy-soft sweaters are the result of over 30 years of expertise, obsessing over fit, durability and handfeel. The result? They're soft and warm while still being lightweight, which means they're the perfect layer to wear on crisp autumn days, under a jacket in colder months...even with a tee on chilly summer nights. This raglan-sleeve sweater is knit in a cozy waffle texture (think of it as a cousin to your favorite thermal).
